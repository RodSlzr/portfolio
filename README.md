## - Air Pollution Mortality

### Description

Using the database "Mortality, morbidity and welfare cost from exposure to environment-related risks" from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OCDE), I present a few visualizations that show the evolution of air pollution consequences in terms of lives and welfare costs during the past 30 years.
You can see my visualizations in this page.

Additionally, I did a Machine Learning Project to compare the forecast of the premature deaths due to air pollution in the Balkans using SVD and LSTM.
You can read the project here, and take a look at the code here.
