# Comparison of SVD and LSTM using time series data of premature deaths due to air pollution from the Balkans
### By Rodrigo Salazar & Sophie Logan
Machine Learning Project to compare the forecast of the premature deaths due to air pollution in one of the most affected regions, the Balkans, using SVD and LSTM. You can read the project [here](https://rodslzr.github.io/portfolio/Air%20pollution%20mortality/Pollution_in_the_Balkans.pdf ), and take a look at the code [here](https://github.com/RodSlzr/portfolio/blob/main/Air%20pollution%20mortality/Final%20Project%20MFML.ipynb).

### Technologies Used

Pandas, NumPy, ARIMA, PyTorch, Matplotlib, and Plotly

## Files Structure

### -[Data Viz (Independent Project, same data source, broader focus)](https://github.com/RodSlzr/portfolio/tree/main/Air%20pollution%20mortality/Data_Viz)
Contains the files to produce the data visualizations and analysis of the worldwide data. You can see my visualizations in this [page](https://rodslzr.github.io/portfolio/Air%20pollution%20mortality/Data_Viz/).

### -data
Contains the clean data for the ML project of the premature death rates of the "Mortality, morbidity and welfare cost from exposure to environmental-related risk" database from the Organization for Economic, Co-operation and Development (OECD). From 1990 to 2019 of 204 countries, filtering the Balkans.

### -Final Project MFML.ipynb
ML code using the SVD and LSTM approaches.

### -Pollution_in_the_Balkans.pdf
Final document with the results of this project.
