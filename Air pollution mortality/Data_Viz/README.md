### Description

Using the database "Mortality, morbidity and welfare cost from exposure to environment-related risks" from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OCDE), I present a few visualizations that show the evolution of air pollution consequences in terms of lives and welfare costs during the past 30 years.
You can see my visualizations in this [page](https://rodslzr.github.io/portfolio/Air%20pollution%20mortality/Data_Viz/).
