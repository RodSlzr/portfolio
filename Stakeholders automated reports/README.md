# Stakeholders automated reports
### By Rodrigo Salazar, Diego Mart√≠nes, & Karla Tamez

In 2022, while interning at the Embassy of Mexico in the US, two other interns and I designed and developed a Stakeholders App that generated tailored reports for the embassy on key stakeholders such as congress representatives, business organizations, non-profits, and think tanks. The reports consisted of a political profile section, an economic analysis section, and a press section. They include synthesized relevant information and visuals.

### Our process involved the following steps:

1. Data collection: We sourced reliable APIs and utilized web scraping techniques to collect relevant data. For the press section, we additionally employed Twint to gather Tweets.

2. Back-end platform design: We wrote code to collect the most current data, clean, process, and store it in a database that we accessed using SQL.

3. Front-end platform design: We used Flask and a client-server model to design a simple interface that enabled users to receive customized reports and update qualitative information.

4. Project development: We worked closely with the embassy to ensure that the app met their specific needs and requirements and significantly improved their stakeholders' full reports. We were solely responsible for the technical aspect of the project, and the embassy was extremely pleased with the final product.

As the initial intern selected for the project, I invited two classmates to join me in collaborating and working together. Our team was involved in every aspect of the project, from the initial design and development phase to the final product. However, my primary responsibility was in the front-end part of the project.
